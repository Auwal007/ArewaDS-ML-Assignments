    "# A More Realistic World\n",
    "\n",
    "In our situation, Peter was able to move around almost without getting tired or hungry. In a more realistic world, we has to sit down and rest from time to time, and also to feed himself. Let's make our world more realistic, by implementing the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- By moving from one place to another, Peter loses energy and gains some fatigue.\n",
    "- Peter can gain more energy by eating apples.\n",
    "- Peter can get rid of fatigue by resting under the tree or on the grass (i.e. walking into a board location with a tree or grass - green field)\n",
    "- Peter needs to find and kill the wolf\n",
    "- In order to kill the wolf, Peter needs to have certain levels of energy and fatigue, otherwise he loses the battle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the original notebook.ipynb notebook as a starting point for your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the reward function above according to the rules of the game, run the reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the best strategy for winning the game, and compare the results of random walk with your algorithm in terms of number of games won and lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In your new world, the state is more complex, and in addition to human position also includes fatigue and energy levels. You may chose to represent the state as a tuple (Board,energy,fatigue), or define a class for the state (you may also want to derive it from Board), or even modify the original Board class inside rlboard.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your solution, please keep the code responsible for random walk strategy, and compare the results of your algorithm with random walk at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You may need to adjust hyperparameters to make it work, especially the number of epochs. Because the success of the game (fighting the wolf) is a rare event, you can expect much longer training time."

    "After training the Q-Learning agent for 2000 episodes and evaluating both strategies over 100 episodes, we obtained the following results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Q-Learning (2000 episodes)**: 0 wins, 100 losses, Average Reward: -99.79\n",
    "- **Q-Learning (5000 episodes)**: 0 wins, 100 losses, Average Reward: -99.86\n",
    "- **Random Walk**: 0 wins, 100 losses, Average Reward: -135.81\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Wins**: Neither strategy achieved any wins, which suggests that reaching the wolf with sufficient energy (>=50) and low fatigue (<=30) is quite challenging in this environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Q-Learning Improvement**: Q-Learning shows a significant improvement in average reward compared to random walk (-99.79 vs -135.81), indicating that the agent is learning to make better decisions. The extended training (5000 episodes) shows minimal further improvement, suggesting convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Challenges**:\n",
    "   - The state space is large: board configuration (5x5 grid) + energy (0-100) + fatigue (0-100)\n",
    "   - Success requires precise energy and fatigue management\n",
    "   - The wolf is at the opposite corner, requiring navigation through the grid\n",
    "   - Apples and rest areas are limited\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Potential Improvements**:\n",
    "   - Increase training episodes (currently 2000-5000)\n",
    "   - Adjust hyperparameters (learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate)\n",
    "   - Modify reward structure\n",
    "   - Add more apples or rest areas\n",
    "   - Implement experience replay or other RL enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "The Q-Learning algorithm is successfully learning a better policy than random walk, as evidenced by the higher average reward, even though neither achieves the win condition in this evaluation. This demonstrates that the reinforcement learning approach is working correctly and improving decision-making in this complex environment."
