## Search for a Bot: My Experience

Bots are becoming increasingly common across digital platforms, from websites to mobile apps and even phone-based customer service systems. For this assignment, I explored the use of a chatbot on the website of a financial services company. These bots are often designed to handle customer inquiries about account balances, transactions, and general support, which made it an ideal choice to analyze.

When I first interacted with the bot, I noticed it had a friendly, conversational style. The interface allowed me to type questions such as “How do I reset my password?” and “What are your customer service hours?” The bot quickly responded with accurate and helpful information, often accompanied by links to detailed support articles. This suggests that the bot was likely integrated with a knowledge base and a set of predefined responses to common customer queries.

The presumed architecture of the bot appears to be a combination of rule-based responses and natural language processing (NLP). Rule-based responses are triggered when a user types a question that matches pre-programmed keywords or phrases. For example, when I asked “How do I open a new account?” the bot instantly provided a step-by-step answer that looked like it was pulled from a script. On the other hand, NLP capabilities were evident when I rephrased the same question in multiple ways. Instead of becoming confused, the bot was able to recognize the intent behind my question and still give a relevant answer. This indicates that the bot relies on intent recognition models that map user input to specific categories of responses.

I attempted to confuse the bot by asking vague or unrelated questions, such as “What’s your favorite movie?” and “Can you tell me a joke?” In these cases, the bot either gave a generic error message or redirected me back to supported topics like account help and customer services. This limitation suggests that while the bot is effective within its domain, it is not designed for open-ended conversation. The failure occurred because the bot lacks the broad conversational intelligence of advanced AI models and instead focuses narrowly on banking-related queries.

Reflecting on the experience, I realized that bots like this are built primarily for efficiency and scalability. A financial company likely deploys such a bot to reduce the load on human agents and provide customers with instant responses at any time of the day. While it cannot handle unrelated or complex questions, it excels in its intended role by delivering quick, structured, and accurate assistance. The reason I could confuse the bot with unrelated prompts is that its training and rule sets were never designed for entertainment or broad conversations. This demonstrates the trade-off between specialization and flexibility in chatbot design.

In conclusion, my experience shows that bots are valuable tools when designed with clear goals and a focused knowledge base. The presumed architecture is a hybrid of rule-based scripting and NLP for intent recognition. Although limited in scope, the bot was effective in handling banking inquiries, which is its primary function. This assignment highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of current chatbot technology and gave me a better appreciation of how businesses leverage them to improve customer support.
